## 2.10.0
**March 10, 2020**

* Performance improvements with how Javascript is loaded and how CSS is compiled
    * Note for developers: This change will require you to re-run `lando npm install` in your working theme directory in order for your `lando gulp` command to continue working. Additionally, the default gulp command does a lot more behind the scenes and will take longer to run. For quicker development, use either `lando gulp watch` or run `lando sass:dev` to just compile sass files.
* New Feature: weather/emergency alerts can now be activated through the theme
