* different links indicating the types of documents and a link that opens in a new windowNew Feature: links that open documents will now automatically indicate what kind of file it is. For example, a link that is a Word document will now have a '(Word)' indicator, PDFs will have a '(PDF)' indicator, etc. Links that open in a new tab/window will have a "opens in new window" indicator.
    * You may notice redundancies if you've already included the document type in the link--if so, you can remove the extension since Ashlar will add them automatically.
*  More cleanup of libraries to improve load times
