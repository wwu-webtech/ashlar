## 2.8.3 - 2.8.6
**November 12, 2019**

* Space/font size fixes for admin menus
* Alerts JS fix
* Add jump to results link to MABEL


## 2.8.2
**November 4, 2019**

* Theme Cleanup:
    * Removed Ashlar .html.twig templates for nodes and comments. Default Drupal templates will get used instead.
    * Some .twig.html templates cleaned up for more consistent coding with other templates (only really affects pattern lab)
    * SASS clean up
    * fix validation errors resulting from duplicate class and id attributes in menus

## 2.8.0
**October 28, 2019**

* @mixins are replacing @extend rules, for more maintainable code
* New block type: Banner
* .big-bold-headings class replaces .erm-headings
    * Styles improved
    * On blocks with customizable headings (beyond basics, image w/ desc, and new banner block) field_heading_style is replacing field_heading_font. The latter will still work, but is being deprecated
* Added logic for p-h6--largest font sizes (applies to .big-bold-headings), removed .title-font sizes
* In pattern lab, backgrounds are now a separate atom. Only one twig file needs to be updated when adding new components to different background colors.
* Knockout fonts removed, some unused make-waves stylesheets removed
* Contrast improved on warning messages
* Link option added to email signature pronouns
* Ultimenu styles added to prepare for version 2.0.0
* Skip-to-content links improved
