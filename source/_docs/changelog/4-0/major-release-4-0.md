Ashlar version 4.0.0 has been deployed. Most of the changes for version 4 are on the back end coding side of things, but there are some front end style updates you may have noticed. Some of these include:

* New link styles, including styles for visited links
* Default headings are now sans serif. Serif heading styles can still be used on a per-block basis, or can be set site-wide by WebTech.
* Minor style changes to buttons and call to action links (formerly called "links styled as buttons")
* New custom styles are available for a handful of blocks, including background colors on accordion blocks
* Testimonial styles have a similar look and feel, but have been modified slightly
* If you have selected Dark Mode in your operating system settings, sites will now display in dark mode by default. You can change to light mode using display settings.

A couple of less-used style variations on components (for example, a headline style) have been removed. In these cases, the components will appear as the default style after the changes go live.
