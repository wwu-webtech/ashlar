### Some performance improvements around how fonts are loaded
Only essential fonts are preloaded now. The material icons font (which is quite larger) is no longer loaded by default. Instead:

* Components with static icons (like the WWU Header and footer, and some components like content switchers) now use SVG versions of the material icons. So these are still packaged with those components
* Drupal block types that use material icons in an open ended way (like Call to Action links and Announcements) will load the library when they are included in a page
* They are loaded as part of the accordion library. So if you are already loading ashlar/accordion (say, in a view) then you also get material icons
* They can also be included by themselves by loading the ashlar/material-icons library (for example, in a view using the **Views Attach Library** module)

If you notice a page where material icons were loading, but aren't any more, please [mailto:masons7@wwu.edu](contact Stephanie) so she can advise on the best way to get the library loaded in your use case.
