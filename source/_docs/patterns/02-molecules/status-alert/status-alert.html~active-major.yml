      <p><strong>10/31/19, 3:30 PM, UPDATE:</p></strong> Staff are still working to resolve the issue with WWUwireless and WWUwireless-Guest. Some browsers and devices are <a href='#'>able to connect</a>. For those that are not, we recommend connecting to WWUwireless-Secure. If a guest/visitor needs wireless access, a student or staff member can create a temporary guest account for them that will work with WWUwireless-Secure: https://www.wwu.edu/guestacct/</p>
