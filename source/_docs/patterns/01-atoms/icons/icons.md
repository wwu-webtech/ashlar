# Icons

## Material Symbol Icons
We utilize [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) as icons. These icons are included in blocks that have an icon field, and can also be loaded via the ashlar/material-icons library. For performance reasons, components in Ashlar now use SVG versions of these icons rather than the font.
