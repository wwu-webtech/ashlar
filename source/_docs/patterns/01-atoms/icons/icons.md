# Icons

## Material Symbol Icons
We utilize [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) for some of our components. These icons are included in blocks that have an icon field, and can also be loaded via the ashlar/material-icons library. For performance reasons, components in Ashlar now use SVG versions of these icons rather than the font. 

Note that *Material Icons* and *Material Symbols* have some differences in the available icon sets and naming conventions for individual icons. We use the Icons set, not Symbols.
