# Ashlar Six
This is a temporary fork of [Ashlar](https://bitbucket.org/wwuweb/ashlar/src/main/) for purposes of launching the 6.0 version of the theme along side the 5.5 version for the duration of Fall 2025. Early adopters can enable this theme in the Appearance setting of their sites. In December of 2025, all sites will use this version of the theme.

No development should happen on this fork, unless it is specifically to fix a big related to theme naming conventsion (eg changing ashlar to ashlar_six somewhere so the theme can find the correct library)

All actual theme development should happen on the main Ashlar repository, and changes merged into the 6.0.0 branch. That branch can then be synced to this fork for deployment to sites that have opted into using this version of the theme early.
